# Solowork

**Status:** Just getting started

I would guess many people who have worked for themselves in some capacity can empathize with being disorganized. When I realized I had a problem, I looked for existing open source software for time tracking, task management, and various similar features. There are some really cool projects out there, but none felt right for me. I also have fond memories of using a retro business terminal at an old job that was keyboard driven and super responsive. That allowed me to build muscle memory and fly through tasks. So I figured why not build my own?

## Documentation

The `docs` directory is AI generated and lightly human reviewed. Expect mistakes and inaccuracies. I find it can be helpful context for agents until the project is more fleshed out.
